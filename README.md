## Task
What is the problem? And where is the challenge?

It is a continuation of the Basecamp 1 project with several developments. 
My basecamp 1 project was written in 'Ruby on rails', my 'basecamp 2' 
project was written in 'laravel framework' unlike my first project.
I wrote my project first in my VS Code, 
then uploaded it to qwasar, and I had a few problems, 
I had some difficulties installing laravel and using it.
